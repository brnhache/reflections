When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate, and to have access on your github account to your project from any
    computer. Also, to show off any projects to potential employers or just for fun!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you are collaborating with a team, and they push something onto the remote,
    you might not want their work to be automatically pulled onto your local machine.
    Instead, deciding when to pull manually gives you more control over your version 
    of the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    FORKS are github repository copies that you make from one user to your account.
    	-You fork a repository when you would like to make changes to someone elses work,
    	but not change their version on their github.

    CLONES are github repositorys you have made a copy of to your local machine.
    	-You would make a clone at the point when you want to edit or add code to a 
    	repository from your own machine.

    BRANCHES are copies of code that will have changes you dont want to impliment
    	into your master branch, at least at that time. it is a new road to take your code 
    	down while leaving a version intact that you can come back to and make different 
    	decisions with. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
